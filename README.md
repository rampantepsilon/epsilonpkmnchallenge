<h1>RampantEpsilon's Pokemon Challenge</h1>
<p>This project came to fruition after me and my friend, peacemaker2448, attempted a Nuzlocke for Pokemon Sun/Moon. This challenge is not meant for people that are used to Nuzlockes. However, this is a good entry-level challenge for those interested.</p>

<p>You can download the files yourself and set everything up within Firebase or you can visit <a href='https://epsilonpkmnchallenge.firebaseapp.com'>epsilonpkmnchallenge.firebaseapp.com</a> and play there.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback or suggestions for this challenge, please contact me on Discord @ RampantEpsilon#7868</p>
